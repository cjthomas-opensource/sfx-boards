Parts notes for version "a":

- The terminal blocks are expensive. If I make another version, adjust the
  layout so that I can easily use headers instead.

- The power switch is very expensive. Use the manufacturer's recommended
  replacement for the SLB12814 switch I'd used last time instead of the new
  CK one. This will take up more space but that's acceptable.
